## Ruby on Rails template ready for deploying in GCP Cloud Run with GitHub Actions Pipeline
### This proyect is about GCP deployment with Github Actions, WIF Authentication, Docker... Not about ror code. The code is mostly based in Templatus, for further information refer to that repository.

This is some basic implementation of the new github actions cloudrun deployment.
It uses WIF for Authentication as Google recomends, so no keys are needed. 

Feel free to fork and modify this repository to satisfy your needs.
